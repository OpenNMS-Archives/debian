Description: Enterprise-grade Open-source Network Management Platform (Full Install)
 OpenNMS is an enterprise-grade network management system written in Java.
 .
 OpenNMS can monitor various network services to determine status and service
 level availability.  Data collection is performed using protocols such as SNMP
 to generate reports and alert on thresholds.  An extensible event management
 and notification system handles both internally and externally generated
 events (such as SNMP traps), and generates notices via email, pager, SMS, etc.
 .
 This package provides the components needed for a reasonable default
 installation of OpenNMS.

 This package provides the Jetty version of the OpenNMS web UI, which runs
 embedded in the main OpenNMS daemon.  This is the recommended web UI, unless
 you have a specific need for the standalone web UI.  The default URL for this
 web UI is 'http://yourhost:8180/opennms/'

 .
 OpenNMS can monitor various network services to determine status and service
 level availability.  Data collection is performed using protocols such as SNMP
 to generate reports and alert on thresholds.  An extensible event management
 and notification system handles both internally and externally generated

 This package provides the standalone version of the OpenNMS web UI, which runs
 in Tomcat or another servlet container, independent of the main OpenNMS daemon.
 The default URL for this web UI is http://yourhost:8280/opennms/
 .
 If you are installing this on a separate machine from the opennms-server
 package, it is recommended that you share the files in /etc/opennms/ between
 the two machines (using NFS or something similar).  Otherwise, configuration
 changes made through the web UI will not actually take effect in the main
 OpenNMS daemon.
