Description: open network monitoring and management application
 OpenNMS is an enterprise-grade network management system written in Java.
 It can perform availability monitoring of various network services to
 determine status and service level availability. Data collection is
 performed using protocols such as SNMP to generate reports as well as
 alert on thresholds. An extensible event managment and notification 
 system handles both internally and externally generated events, (such as 
 SNMP traps), plus generates notices, (email, pager, SMS, etc), for 
 configured events.
