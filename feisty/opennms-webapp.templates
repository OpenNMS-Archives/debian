Description: Necessary changes to Tomcat for pre-1.1.4 upgrades
  The Tomcat4 server context has been moved from /etc/tomcat4/server.xml
  to its own standalone file, /var/lib/tomcat4/webapps/opennms.xml. Per
  the release notes, be sure that you have removed the old context before
  attempting to access the webapp, (the two will conflict).
