Type: note
Description: Installer must now be ran manually
  Previous versions of this package would invoke the installer to handle
  initial setup, or upgrade an existing database. This is no longer the
  case. You must manually run /usr/share/opennms/bin/install to complete
  this install/upgrade. Full install documentation can be found in the 
  opennms-doc package, and is also available online at the Sourforge
  project page, (http://sf.net/projects/opennms).
